# Command Plugin and Route Plugin

Create a command plugin and a route plugin so that upon selecting a profile, the user is redirected to a route plugin where the details of the information present in the "From" addressbook field will be displayed.

After displaying the information, create 2 links that can direct the user to a search where some parameters are valued (e.g., the "To" parameter and the DocumentType). 

Create a second link that, through a view, directly shows the results applying the same search filters.
